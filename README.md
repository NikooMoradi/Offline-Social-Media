My Object Oriented Programming course project, written in java and using swing for graphics

This project is a simulated offline social media, inspired by Twitter, which allows users to create both personal and business accounts. You can share tweets, upload photos, comment, follow others, like or dislike posts, and engage in private chats or group chats with friends. For businesses, it's a great place to promote products, companies, or small-scale ventures. 

The possibilities are limitless. 
Dive into our social media community and relish the experience of connecting with new people while enjoying your time to the fullest. ;)
